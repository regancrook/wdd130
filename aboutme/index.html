    <p>I have been married to my husband Josh for 4 years. We have two boys. Donovan is 3 years old, and Gabriel is 2 years old. I love to read fantasy, romance, and romantic comedy books. I enjoy going to the gym, taking my boys on bike rides, and hiking.  </p>
    <p>I joined the church in May 2017. My now husband is the one that introduced me to the church. I was baptized 2 months after my first Sunday. One of my favorite scriptures is "Therefore, hold up your light that it may shine unto the world." (3 Nephi 18:24) Ever since joining the church, I have loved sharing my testimony. I believe it is so important to share it. You never know who might need to hear it, or is praying for someone to give them some insight to their troubles.</p>
    <p>I attended school whenever I first graduated high school in 2011. I could not decide on a major, and was constantly changing majors. I ended up graduating with a Bachelors in General Studies, in December of 2018. I knew I would want to go back to school one day, but had no idea what it would be for. This past winter I was in charge of moving over inventory at my job, into a new system. I had to learn the whole system, and be able to train others on it. It made me realize how much I have always enjoyed technology. I started looking into computer programming, and decided it sounded like something I'd enjoy. I did some free coding classes online, just to make sure I was interested. I finally decided on the BS degree in Applied Technology, focusing on web design and computer programming. I cannot wait to see what all I learn in this course. Thank you so much for reading about me.</p>
