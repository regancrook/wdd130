        <p> How safe is it to rent an inflatable?
            Please refer to all of the instructions and guidelines listed on your rental contract and on the unit itself. It is important that all users follow the rules listed on the contract and the unit. The inflatables are all safety-rated and exceed industry safety standards. This means that they are built with safety in mind, using the latest in high-security designs and fire retardant materials.
    
            How many people will your inflatables hold?
            The maximum number of riders of each group that should play in a bounce house is 6-8 kids, that are the same size. No big kids with small kids.
    
            Will the Inflatable harm my lawn?
            We cannot guarantee that the inflatable will not affect your lawn. In most cases, it will only temporarily flatten the grass, which should recover in a few days. When renting a waterslide, damage can occur to the lawn in the area around the slide itself. This is primarily the result of water getting under the tarp and a high amount of foot traffic in one concentrated area.
    
            What type of power is required for an inflatable?
            The inflatable should be within 100ft. of a 110v outlet, on it's own 15-20 amp circuit. We will supply the power cord, but we do ask that nothing else be plugged into the outlet being used. Some of our larger inflatables might need multiple outlets on separate circuits.
