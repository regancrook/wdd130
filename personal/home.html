        <p>Intro to inflatables:     
          Playground equipment is one thing, but when it comes to seeing children's eyes light up in excitement, nothing else does the trick quite like inflatables and bounce houses.
            Kids can do things in inflatables that they can't do anywhere else. The bouncy walls of a bounce house let kids jump and fly like nothing else. They also can move full speed without having to worry about impact injuries. 
            These air-filled amusements are becoming more common, with schools, churches and other groups investing in them. 
            
            SO MANY WAYS TO PLAY
            You can take your pick of inflatables! Bounce houses are basically self-contained trampolines! Bounce houses with slides are multitasking inflatables that give kids even more ways to have fun! Inflatable water slides are outstanding for hot summer days!
